lets work on restructuring the existing project, 
lets start with rules.json

here, the json should be dynamically generated. i.e, from a form,
we want to make a defualt rules.json template. 
we give a form, which would be like:
- file ( example: selected index.html)
- attributes
- functions
- synatx
- other functions

- file( example: app.py)
- attributes
- functions
- synatx
- imports
- other features


this should generate the json file
